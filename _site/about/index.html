    <h1>Who am I?</h1>

<p>Hi there, I&#39;m David Cao. I&#39;m currently a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania studying <a href="http://www.nets.upenn.edu/">Networked and Social Systems Engineering</a>, or NETS for short. This is my personal website and blog that I will hopefully keep up to date.</p>

<p>What is NETS you ask? It&#39;s the study of how we interact with networks, how they affect our lives, and how we can use this information to build solutions and platforms that anticipate how these systems will act. A network can be anything, from your circle of friends to the entire U.S. highway system. As a NETS major, I&#39;ll be studying various disciples such as mathematics, game theory, economics, and sociology, with a main focus on computer science. </p>

<h2>What do I do?</h2>

<p>At school, I&#39;m a CIS 160 (discrete math) Teaching Assistant, water polo player, and avid hacker. In my own time, I&#39;m an iOS developer, swimmer, aspiring Go developer, and (still) avid hacker. I&#39;m also interested in UI design, entrepreneurship, and pure mathematics.</p>

<h2>Internships</h2>

<p>In the summer after my senior year in high school, I interned at a software company called the Datamaxx Group. There I developed a secure iOS chat application in compliance with FIPS 140-2. I learned how to work on a small scale development team and how to follow a development work flow.</p>

<p>This summer I worked at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center as a software intern. I developed an iOS application for the Integrated Space Weather Analysis system, or iSWA. iSWA allows space weather forecasters to stream data from various satellites monitoring the Sun and then analyze that data in order to make an accurate forecast. </p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<p>I created two apps during high school, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-phillipian/id925848839?mt=8">The Phillipian</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/andover-tour/id975588829?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Andover Mobile Tour</a>. The Phillipian is an app for my school&#39;s newspaper, and Andover Mobile Tour allows a prospective student or visitor to tour the campus. The mobile tour was an independent project during my senior year at Phillips Academy Andover.</p>

<p>At UPenn, I&#39;m currently working on a social app called Loop as mainly an iOS developer, but moving towards a full stack engineer. I can&#39;t say much, but we hope to release it soon! </p>

<p>I&#39;m currently learning Google&#39;s new language, Go, in conjunction with Swift. A friend and I will be working on a server-client game in order to put our knowledge to use. We are also using this opportunity to learn web security and encryption.</p>

<h2>Trivial Pursuits</h2>

<p>In my downtime, I enjoy swimming, water polo, pen spinning, playing video games, and creating the next middle-out compression algorithm (if you haven&#39;t noticed yet I&#39;m a big fan of Silicon Valley). </p>
