# Who am I?
Hi there, I'm David Cao. I'm currently a sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania studying [Networked and Social Systems Engineering](http://www.nets.upenn.edu/), or NETS for short. 

What is NETS you ask? It's the study of how we interact with networks, how they affect our lives, and how we can use the information it provides us. A network can be anything, from your circle of friends to the entire U.S. highway system. MORE PLS 

What do I do?
