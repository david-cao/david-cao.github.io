title:  Hello World
---

This is my first post, and tradition suggests that one should start with a salutation to the world. Since I'm learning Go, I thought it'd be appropriate to set the tone of this blog with a quick helloworld program in Go.

{% highlight go %}
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello world")
}
{% endhighlight %}

So I guess this will be more of a technical blog, I'll be sharing various problems I encounter or neat things I learn. There will be lots of Go and Swift, since those are what I'm currently learning, and of course Objective-C.
